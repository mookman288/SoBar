#SoBar

##The Social Media Icon Bar

###Developed by [PxO Ink](http://pxo.ink/)

####Preface

SoBar is designed to provide svg-based social media icon 
experience. SoBar can be used in a standalone manner by 
setting a width or height on an image element using an svg 
as a source. Alternatively, this repository comes packaged 
with CSS designed to provide a slightly more modular icon 
system. 

Unlike its predecessor, SMIB, SoBar has no limiting factor 
of attractivity. Any size can be used, with any styles, 
which allows for complete customization within the 
confines of the branding guidelines for each icon:
