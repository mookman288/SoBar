# Social Media Icon Bar

## Developed by PxO Ink (http://pxoink.net/)

### Preface

The *Social Media Icon Bar* was designed to provide a simple
CSS sprite social media icon experience. Unlike alternatives,
such as social media button generators, or applications like
ShareThis, SMIB allows for complete control over hyperlinks, 
icons, and styles.

Utilizing the most readily-available official icons, while
attempting to adhere to each and every branding guideline,
SMIB hopes to provide an easy to use, and fairly efficient 
method for loading social media icons. 

If you've found one of these icons breaking some arbitrary
rule or regulation, let me know and I will either fix it or 
remove it.

### Demonstration

A demonstration is located within the index.html file.

### Installation

To install, simply include the enclosed CSS file within the head
of your document, and call the appropriate classes on the element
you wish to use. 

### Compatibility

SMIB was tested, and is in working condition, within the following browsers:

* Internet Explorer 8+
* Chrome 20+
* Opera 12+
* FireFox 14+
