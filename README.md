# Social Media Icon Bar

## Developed by PxO Ink (http://pxoink.net/)

### Preface

The *Social Media Icon Bar* is designed to provide a simple
CSS sprite social media icon experience. Unlike alternatives,
such as social media button generators, or applications like
ShareThis, SMIB allows for complete control over hyperlinks, 
icons (in the form of a CSS sprite,) and styles.

Utilizing the most attractive icon format (24px,) while
attempting to adhere to each and every branding guideline,
SMIB hopes to provide an easy to use, and fairly efficient 
framework for loading social media icons as a CSS sprite.

### Customization

The focus of this project is to provide a clean framework 
in which any developer may expand, modify, or manipulate 
the output for their own purposes. As such, customization 
of this project is expected. Knowledge of graphic design, 
CSS and HTML is required.

### Demonstration

Each aspect of this application works as a demonstration for 
your own creative implementations. An index.html file, a 
modified CSS framework, and a CSS sprite is included for 
your convenience and demonstration only.

A demonstration of the efficiency of minifying a CSS file is  
also included for your convenience.

### Compatibility

The CSS SMIB framework was tested, and is in working condition, 
within the following browsers:

* Internet Explorer 8+
* Chrome 20+
* Opera 12+
* FireFox 14+
